Worldgen isn't has hard as it seems.

The way it happens is as follows:

// CF -> PF -> BM

ConfiguredFeature -> Placed Feature -> Biome Modifier

Great examples of Configured Features can be found in the `package net.minecraft.data.worldgen.features` package.

Great examples of Placed Features can be found in the `package net.minecraft.data.worldgen.placement` package.

In the end, the Biome Modifier is what actually adds the feature to the biome.
